### Overview
This repository contains the Matlab implementation of our algorithm  for [2018中国研究生数学建模竞赛F题](https://cpipc.chinadegrees.cn/cw/hp/4)  There are three parts in this package:
The competition content detail is in the file:
```
    ./机场新增卫星厅对中转旅客影响的评估方法.pdf
```
the problem can be casted to a mathametical discrete optimization problem.
Our algorithm is mainly based on [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) ,  which is described in the solution report file:   
```   
    ./F18103350032.pdf
```
The matlab code is in directory:
```
    ./code_matlab/
```
